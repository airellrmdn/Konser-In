                        <p>Influential bands of the early 21st century. Their direct, hooky sound — equally inspired by classic tunesmiths like
                            Buddy Holly and the brash attitude of fellow New Yorkers the Velvet Underground and Ramones — set trends even as it
                            looked back on rock history. With their acclaimed 2001 debut, Is This It, the Strokes reinvigorated a rock scene
                            that had spent years focused on post-grunge and nu-metal. Along with the White Stripes and Yeah Yeah Yeahs, they
                            helped shape the sound and look of alternative rock in the 2000s, with Kings of Leon, the Killers, and the
                            Libertines, Franz Ferdinand, and Arctic Monkeys reflecting their impact in the U.S. and the U.K., respectively.</p>

                        <p>After four studio albums, there’s not much territory The 1975 hasn’t covered at this point. Throughout their tenure
                            as a band, the English rockers have flirted with glossy pop, anarchist punk, gritty garage rock, electro-funk and
                            country. They’ve used their incisive songwriting to ask existential questions surrounding self-discovery, nihilism,
                            climate change, mental health, addiction, postmodernism and cybersex. So what’s a band to do when they’ve seemingly
                            done it all? After 20 years together, The 1975 decided it was time for a return to form—a way to celebrate their
                            beginnings and showcase their growth. The result is their fifth effort Being Funny in a Foreign Language—perhaps the
                            band’s most intimate sounding record yet.</p>

                        <p>The Kid LAROI – the newly eighteen year old rapper/singer born Charlton Howard is proving that for an incoming
                            generation filled with promising talent, yesterday’s borders aren’t today’s barriers. Born and raised in Sydney
                            (aside from a short stint in the countryside) to a mother of Aboriginal descent and a French father, LAROI was
                            raised by his mother and his uncle in a gritty environment. When they weren’t at The Fact Tree, a local youth center
                            where they played video games and pool, LAROI and his friends were on the streets. LAROI grew up consuming one of
                            America’s most adored exports, listening to hip-hop and R&B icons like Tupac, Erykah Badu, The Fugees, Lil Wayne and
                            Kanye West. He’s wanted to make music since he can remember, hoping to claim a spot in music royalty.</p>
